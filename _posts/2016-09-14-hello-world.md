Many of you have surely noticed that [www.citygml.org](http://www.citygml.org) wasn't updated as often as it should. But do not worry, it will from now on be frequently updated, and its content will be expanded.

The [3D geoinformation research group at TU Delft](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl) will be from now on responsible for the site.
