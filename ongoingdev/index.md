Here one page per topics, I propose:

  - [improved 16 LODs for buildings](tudelft-lods)
  - [Handling of massive terrain proposal](massiveterrain)
  - [dynamizers](dynamizers)
  - utility networks (TUM)
  - versioning within a file, planning alternatives (v3.0), multiple futures and multiple pasts
